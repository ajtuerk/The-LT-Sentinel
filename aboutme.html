<!-- BLURB -->
Here, you can find a quick synopsis of where I've been, what I've seen and what
I've done so far.

<!-- EVENTS -->

July 16, 1998 -- I was born!

...fast-forward a bit...

August 2016 -- I start my freshman year at the University of Maryland,
declaring Economics as my major!

January - May 2017 -- I try out a radical change in my academic career,
going off the Economics rails and taking the introductory classes to become
a bioengineer. (spoiler alert - I didn't become one)

January 2018 -- I register for my first course in Journalism, News Writing and
Reporting I, with one of my favorite professors, Matthew Hay Brown. At the
time, he was at The Baltimore Sun; one of my favorite assignments he would do
is print out a crime briefing from the police and have us write from that. It
would really come in handy later when I needed to synthesize information quickly
and figure out what should lead and what can be saved for last.

December 2018 -- I finish out my last requirements for my degree in Economics,
closing out one of the hardest semesters of my life. I had to split my time between
game theory, advanced econometrics and statistic analysis, capital markets,
economic policy research and business reporting!

January 2019 -- I enter the fall semester a full-fledged journalism student at the
Philip Merrill College of Journalism (finally!). I write for a couple on-campus publications,
dipping my feet in what is to later become the focus of almost every waking hour of
every day.

June - August 2019 -- I take an internship at The Sentinel Papers, covering
Prince George's and Montgomery County here in southern Maryland. My favorite
moment of that hot and sticky summer was my first story, covering a grocery store
opening a mile or two from my house. There I am, sitting in my car, waiting to
summon up the courage to go out and talk to the line of folks waiting for the Lidl
to open, when College Park Mayor Patrick Wojahn strolls by my car. I had no choice.
I run out behind him -- "Mr. Mayor!" -- and nail my first real interview for a
published, physical paper.

September 2019 -- I begin my internship at NPR, working on Here & Now, a nationally-
syndicated news magazine, as well as reporting at the Newsdesk on Saturdays. Stay
tuned for more!
